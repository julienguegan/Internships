changelog of the CMA-ES ATOMS module

Please update this file to describe the modifications of your toolbox

A format of change log could be:


CMA-ES (initial version)
    * Change 0 - initial release (attempt)
    * Change 1 - modified help section to comply with DocBook v5 + added cma_demo()
    * Change 2 - modified builder script, added test script, improved etc/start-script
                 added cleanmacros.sce (as in toolbox skeleton) - although the builder should generate the cleaner script, AFAIK.
                 help files are now utf-8 and cleaned up for better reading
    * Change 3 - modified cma.sci to prevent warning from Scilab (calculating 1./N changed to 1/N)
                 re-modified etc/start and etc/quit script (naming only, nothing important).
                 cma-es.start also runs cma() which loads cma-es library (previously by loader.sce)
                 updated tests/test.sce to load demos/runcma.sce (and demos/ cleaned up).
